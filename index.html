                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Howie Miao, a CS Major in my last semester at CU Boulder. I used to be a Psychology Major when I first started here in 2018, but after a semester I realized that maybe it wasn't for me. I continued to stray away from the family default of a major in Computer Science and attempted a full year in Business. 
                    I had completed the basics of Micro and Macroeconics before I realized I seemed to just be avoiding my passion in tech just because my family had done it before, but I had grown up with it my whole life and it was a huge part of who I was.
                    I find a lot of pleasure in creating things from scratch, learning and understanding how every internal works together and creates a functioning product, as well as creating somethign that makes one's day or life easier. That was and still is my biggest drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With my last semester I've spent most of my time looking for a job and area to apply my honed skill set towards. With previous projects like python integrated bots through a Raspberry Pi Pico, or touching base on new topics like Machine Learning or PyTorch,
                    I've time and time again found passion in creating new things that I never would've thought could have existed just a handful of years ago. 
                </p>
